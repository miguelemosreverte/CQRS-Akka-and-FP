<p>During the years, the cat jump reflex was a phenomena that intrigued the population. They always fell on their feet.<br>
This is <strong>the oldest recording we have of such phenomena</strong>, captured in 1894.</p>

<p>In this project, we are going to make the equivalent of a <strong>cat jump</strong>.<br>
That is, we are going to implement an arquitecture using OOP, for then pivot to FP.</p>
<p>Let’s hope that we land on our feet.</p>
