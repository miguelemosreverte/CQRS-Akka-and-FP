<p>During the years, the cat jump reflex was a phenomena that intrigued the population. They always fell on their feet.<br>
This is <strong>the oldest recording we have of such phenomena</strong>, captured in 1894.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Falling_cat_1894.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>In this project, we are going to make the equivalent of a <strong>cat jump</strong>.<br>
That is, we are going to implement an arquitecture using OOP, for then pivot to FP.</p>
<p>Let’s hope that we land on our feet.</p>
<h1 id="the-architecture">1 - The Architecture</h1>
<p>This is a CQRS diagram, summarized by text:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data comes in</li>
<li>We split the data into it’s most atomic expressions
<ul>
<li>using DomainDrivenDesign as a guide:
<ul>
<li>we are looking for <em>value objects</em>, and <em>entities</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is routed to processors [writeside]
<ul>
<li>this processors are stateful and recover from failure</li>
<li>this processors use Event Sourcing to recover from failure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We react to this events to create an aggregation (ie.: the sum, the average)
<ul>
<li>using DomainDrivenDesign as a guide:
<ul>
<li>now we are looking for <em>aggregates</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We store this aggregations to a query-friendly database [readside]</li>
</ol>
<p>Now this is the same, but as a painting.<br>

<p>This architecture can be implemented in many ways, no need to couple to any paradigm or framework to do so. After all, it was invented a while ago. Not in 1894 as in the photo of the jumping cat, mind you, but very old and known in terms of CS history.</p>

<pre><code>CQRS was invented when performance was an issue, (still is), and to avoid system overload the entire system was split into two: The writeside, were the most transactional bussiness logic was placed, and then the conclusions, which could take their time to be computed, as it ussually did at the time. (And for some reason, as of 2020, still does).
It is true that even though computers have gotten stronger with the passage of time, our hunger for conclusions has all but decreased. 
Software, someone wiser once said, expands like gas to fill any container, no matter the size. And because of this principle is that we are still talking about CQRS on 2020. Because of performance.
</code></pre>
<p>CQRS means to not block the input of data, to let it come in without throttle. Because it will be <em>then</em> when we will aggregate it’s values to achieve a conclusion.</p>
<p>Until then fullfill those transactions as fast as you can!<br>
<em>Don’t let anyone block you!</em></p>
<p>That is, if I can be concise about it, my definition for CQRS.</p>
<p>Now, let’s cut the talk and let’s talk bussiness.</p>
<h1 id="the-bussiness">2- The Bussiness</h1>
<p>Our domain is going to be about the GDP of countries. How much they earn yearwise.</p>
<p>To do this we are going to have:</p>
<ol>
<li>Entities
<ul>
<li>Country</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Value Objects
<ul>
<li>GDP</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We are going to rank them, this is an aggregation.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Aggregates
<ul>
<li>TopTenCountries</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The top ten countries is an aggregation where we sort the countries by GDP and take the first ten.<br>
It is a conclusion, as such it will be decoupled from the ingestion, which is the writeside. We are going to do it later, on the readside.</p>
<p>It will be eventually consistent with the input, meaning that it may take a while to achieve full consistency with the input from writeside, but it will get there. <em>Eventually</em>.</p>
<p>We can make a drawing out if this. Let’s see.<br>

<p>We can start by modeling Domain Driven Design itself!<br>
